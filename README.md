# IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition
## Project Summary
With the rise of Data Science over the past few years, companies are finding more ways to apply machine learning methods internally. One such way is People Analytics. People Analytics is a data driven way for companies to better understand and manage their employees. It comes as no surprise that IBM is one company that focuses on People Analytics. The focus of this project was on figuring out what causes IBM employees to feel attrited and to create a predictive model that classifies attrited employees. 

The main files for this project can be found under `notebooks`:

- `1_data_wrangling.ipynb`: 
   - Loaded the raw data, doing some basic inspections for data types and null values, and saving it as a usable file.
- `2_eda.ipynb`:
   - An in depth analysis of the data to understand feature distributions and understand what what features might be the most critical in classifiying emlpoyees. Histograms were created to visualize distributions, correlation heatmaps were made to see the relationships between features, countplots represetned the discrete data and box plots explored the continuous data.
